On a webapp with [mui](https://mui.com/) (AKA Material UI), there's everyone favorite component: `<Box />`. Why is [Box beloved](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-box/)? It's because unlike our usual goto div-soup generator, `div` lacks the `sx` prop. It's sort of a mix between inline styles, inline "styled component" syntax, and maybe even a little bit of inline utility css. All in one. Box is boundless with potential.

`<Box />` desugars into `<div />` unless you give it a `component="ul"` prop, then it could become a `<ul />`. My assumption had been for a long time that without Box, I would not get the benefits of having `sx` props as an option. But you can! Using `styled`.

Here's look at an example, we want to make vertical list using a `ul`. Even though it would be great if we could do this, this fails:

```tsx
<br food={{}} />
<ul sx={(theme) => ({ /* ðŸ‘ˆ in general, this would not work, you can't use the sx prop on an ordinary tagged element */
  listStyle: "none",
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  gap: theme.spacing(6),
})}>
    /* more elements */
</ul>
```

As an alternative that actually works, using [`@mui/system` `styled`](https://mui.com/system/styled/), we can give a name to these styles _and_ preserve the `sx` prop capability allowing us to have adhoc styles when we need them still.

```tsx
export const VerticallySpacedList = styled(`ul`)(({ theme }) => ({
  listStyle: "none",
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  gap: theme.spacing(6),
}));
```

Now, we can reference this as we'd like:

```tsx
<VerticallySpacedList>
    /* more elements */
</VerticallySpacedList>
```

What's nice about this is that we can use `sx` on `<VerticallySpacedList />`:

```tsx
<VerticallySpacedList sx={{fontSize: "2rem", lineHeight: 1.5}}>
    /* more elements */
</VerticallySpacedList>
```

This saves us from have an explosion of one-off subtly named components like `VerticallySpacedList` and `VerticallySpacedListWithBiggerTextSize` and `BoldVerticallySpacedList`. There's a core, common style as a base and then `sx` handles incidentials.

[There's nothing quite like Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility css, but with `<Box />`, `sx` and `styled`, maybe it comes in a distant second.
