Have you been running your [Cypress tests](https://www.cypress.io/) in your automated test runner? Have you suddenly come across this seemingly strange error?

```
$ export CYPRESS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
$ yarn cypress run
yarn run v1.22.19
error An unexpected error occurred: "Failed to replace env in config: ${TOKEN}".
info If you think this is a bug, please open a bug report with the information provided in ".../yarn-error.log".

```

I searched by codebase for any usage of a plain `TOKEN` variable but I found nothing. I have token tokens in my automated test runner but those are for pulling packages, pushing packages and authorizing deployment actions. Nothing related to Cypress or otherwise.

The trick I found for this is: make a stubbed `TOKEN` value.

```diff
    step:
        name: cypress
        image: cypress:latest
        commands:
            - export CYPRESS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
+           - export TOKEN=""
            - yarn cypress run
```

I am not sure if this `TOKEN` issue is exclusive to my automated test runner, there were many hits online for a similar problem. Meanwhile, this seems to work well enough so I am not investigating further into the internals of Cypress or my runner.

Then only after that were `âœ”  All specs passed!`.
