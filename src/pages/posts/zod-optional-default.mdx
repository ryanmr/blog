[Zod is great](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). Concise and simple and TypeScript oriented.

I recently ran into a scenario with an object with an optional property with a default. Thinking this schema would just work, I wrote up the schema and the tests and then suddenly it all fell a part.

For example, suppose you have a User with a `name` and a `role`. Then, `name` is required while `role` will default to `guest` if nothing else is supplied.

Here's an zod schema:

```ts
const UserSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  role: z.string().default("guest"),
});
```

Here's a small test, that fails:

```ts
const testUser: z.infer<typeof UserSchema> = {
  name: "name",
};
// Error
// Property 'role' is missing in type '{ name: string; }' but required in type '{ name: string; role: string; }'.
```

In theory, with `.default` having been set on `role`, not providing `role` in the object should be OK. And yet we have an error here.

I thought this error was because `.optional` was not defined in the schema:

```diff
const UserSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
- role: z.string().default("guest"),
+ role: z.string().default("guest").optional(),
});
```

This _seemed_ to make progress, getting rid of the type error, however the output was wrong:

```json
{"name":"name"}
```

Actually, I used the wrong input type. In fact, I did _not use_ the input type, I used the _output type_. There's [a few hints in the docs](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#type-inference:~:text=What%20about%20transforms%3F), but it wasn't very obvious to me either. The original schema was fine, but the _test_ was wrong. Here's how it should look:

```diff
- const testUser: z.infer<typeof UserSchema> = {
+ const testUser: z.input<typeof UserSchema> = {
  name: "name",
};
```

With `z.input`, you may safely omit the `role` property from the object.

Finally, the resulting shape is what we wanted all along:

```json
{"name":"name","role":"guest"}
```
