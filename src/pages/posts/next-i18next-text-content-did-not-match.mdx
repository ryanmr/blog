On a [Next webapp](https://nextjs.org/), I am using [next-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next) (along with its peer dependencies, i18next and react-i18next).

During a routine upgrade, I bumped dependencies in my `package.json` and ran a re-`yarn` right after.

```diff
-    "i18next": "^22.0.6",
-    "next-i18next": "^13.0.0",
+    "i18next": "^22.4.6",
+    "next-i18next": "^13.0.2",
-    "react-i18next": "^12.0.0"
+    "react-i18next": "^12.1.1"
```

Well, after that upgrade, everthing that was working just fine broke!

> next-dev.js?3515:20 Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "welcome:business_units.welcome_message" Client: "Welcome to our..."

This error _was_ occuring when I had used `useTranslation` with keys that were not defined yet in the `serverSideTranslations` call:

```
export const getStaticProps = async ({ locale }: any) => {
  return {
    props: {
      ...(await serverSideTranslations(locale, ["login", "common", "welcome"])),
    },
  };
};
````

That was in place and yet this error was still coming up.

There's a bunch of [troubleshooting tips](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOT.md#how-to-explicitly-pass-the-config) with next-i18next, some focused on other errors, some focused on dependency conflicts. I followed the instructions for reconciling dependency conflicts, but that wasn't the issue this time.

The solution I stumbled onto was converting any instance of the auto-imported `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` (which I was used to using from SPA implementations) into a `next-i18next` import.

```diff
-import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
+import { useTranslation } from "next-i18next";
```

This removed this type of error. I suppose somewhere in one of the minor version updates, there was a refinment of how those `useTranslation` hooks hook into either tree state or global scope state.
