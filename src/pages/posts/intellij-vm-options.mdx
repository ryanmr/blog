I was trying to use Spotless with Java 17. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to use `idea.vmoptions` to tinker with settings I hardly understand.

If you bork you Intellij installation by misformatting the file, it's fine, you can edit manually.

On macOS:

```
cd /Users/ryanrampersad/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/
```

Your config folder's name will depend on the version of Intellij (or any of the other IDEs based on it), so go into that and then `vim` or otherwise edit the `idea.vmoptions` as you need.
