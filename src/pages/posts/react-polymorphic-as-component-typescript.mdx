Do you want a `Button` that can switch between `<button>`, `<a>` and `<Link>`? You need a _polymorphic component_. Ideally you need one with TypeScript support so that you get type safety and autocomplete.

Using an `as` or `component` prop is not too difficult in plain JavaScript flavored React code.

```JavaScript
export function Button({as, children}) {
    const Component = as || 'button';
    return <Component>{children}</Component>
}
```


I was not able to find a first party example of how to make a polymorphic component. With the new [new react.dev docs](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev#whats-next), hopefully this should all be easier and better documented.

Here's how I handle this, based on [this original Stackoverflow post by Gabin](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66568474/2496685), with a few minor modifications.

```TypeScript
interface ButtonProps<T extends React.ElementType> extends React.PropsWithChildren {
  /**
   * polymorphic prop; supply overriding html element or react component
   */
  as?: T;
}

function Button<T extends React.ElementType = "button">({
  as,
  ...props
}:
  ButtonProps<T>
  & Omit<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>, keyof ButtonProps<T>>
) {
  const Component = as ?? "button";
  return <Component {...props} />;
}
```

Now the `Button` can be flip flopped from `<button>` to `<a>` or even `<Link>` and the appropriate props will be required or optional as necessary.

```TypeScript
function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Button>button as a button</Button>
      <Button as="a" href="/">button as an anchor</Button>
      <Button as={Link} to="/">button as a Link</Button>
    </>
  );
}
```
