If you use [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), you are probably logging `level` when you [emit JSON structured logs](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+use+json+structured+logs). You can configure Datadog to respect level, but sometimes its nice to use its defaults instead.

Datadog uses `severity` as an equivalent to `level`. Here's how you can config the field name of `level` to just use `severity` instead.

```js
  const jsonFormat = winston.format.combine(
    winston.format((info) => {
      info["severity"] = info.level;
      delete info.level;
      return info;
    })(),
    winston.format.json()
  );
```

Here, we are setting `info["severity"]` to whatever the `level` would have been. Then right after, we remove the `level` from the info object.
