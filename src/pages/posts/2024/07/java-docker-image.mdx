This is my reference guide for Java flavored docker images. Typically, I'm using this alongside Spring Boot but you could adapt this to any Java-ecosystem framework or whatever ends up running as a `.jar`.

## References

Here are some reference opinions and positions:

### Gradle

In this, the `.jar` files are produced with Gradle defaults. If you find your Gradle is making _two_ `.jar` files for some reason, try turning that off with this in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
tasks.named("jar") {
	enabled = false
}
```

### Layertools

I skip [layertools](https://www.baeldung.com/docker-layers-spring-boot). Since the images are used as carriers for the kubernetes cluster, it's not too important to me that there's layer reuse. In the unlikely event that I am running locally, a few slow rebuilds locally will not materially impact me. But, by all means, use layertools if you think it's worth the extra complexity over including a single simple `.jar` file.

### Alpine

When possible, I prefer [running on alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/). It provides the smallest functional baseline image, which reduces container surface area, reducing potential blocking CVEs.

Sometimes I hear that Alpine, not having [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), and using [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/), impacts performance. While I've never noticed anything like that, it could be true in very precise benchmarking.

### Amazon Corretto

Typically, I am running these containers and these `.jar`s on Amazon metal. I have no major issues using Corretto then. That said, I think it's great having JDK/JRE diversity, so feel free to use another option.

Speaking of options, [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless?tab=readme-ov-file) _could_ be an option if you do not mind forgoing any additional container tooling (like curl, jq, etc), since distroless has no shell.

### Datadog

Typically, I use Datadog. If you do not use Datadog, that's OKâ€”just remove that stage from the builds if it's present. Also, skip this portion of the entrypoint:

```shell
"-javaagent:/app/dd-java-agent.jar", "-Dmanagement.statsd.metrics.export.host=${STATSD_HOST}"
```

## Dockerfiles

Ok, let's build.

### Tiny option

First up, an option with no frills:

```dockerfile
FROM amazoncorretto:17-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./build/libs/*.jar /app/app.jar

RUN adduser -D --uid 1001 --no-create-home roxy
USER 1001

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "--add-exports=java.base/sun.net=ALL-UNNAMED", "app.jar"]
```

### Standard option

Second up, and my recommendation, a very standard option:

```dockerfile
FROM scratch as datadog
WORKDIR /download
ADD https://dtdg.co/latest-java-tracer /download/dd-java-agent.jar

FROM alpine as cert
RUN apk add --update --no-cache ca-certificates

FROM alpine as user
RUN adduser -D --uid 1001 --no-create-home roxy

FROM amazoncorretto:17-alpine
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=datadog --chown=1001 /download/dd-java-agent.jar /app/dd-java-agent.jar
COPY --from=cert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
COPY --from=user /etc/passwd /etc/passwd
COPY ./build/libs/*.jar /app/app.jar

USER 1001

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "-javaagent:/app/dd-java-agent.jar", "-Dmanagement.statsd.metrics.export.host=${STATSD_HOST}", "--add-exports=java.base/sun.net=ALL-UNNAMED", "/app/app.jar"]
```

1. Download datadog java agent
2. Download the latest certs {/* (is this necessary? surely, amazoncorretto has certs that are fine) */}
3. Setup non-root user for execution
4. Copy files from previous steps
5. Copy files `.jar` from outside of docker[^1]
6. Set non-root user (for kubernetes)
7. Setup entrypoint

With all of that, I get an image that's about 343 MB[^2], using a single endpoint health check Spring Boot app.

### Needlessly advanced option

Apparently along with Java 9 (that was a while ago) the JDK/JRE divide became fuzzy. You rarely find docker images with _only_ the JRE. That's because [jlink](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/jlink.html) provides an alternative to produce a runtime from its parent jdk. There are probably other reasons too. Let me know if have advice regarding JRE docker images.

With the [help of Synk](https://medium.com/@snyksec/using-jlink-to-create-smaller-docker-images-for-your-spring-boot-java-application-5e21a3377965), here's the Dockerfile concoction that trims down the runnable image. Here's the warning: it _might_ technically compile and even _work_. But who knows why, or how, or really if it's a good idea. For what it's worth, with all of that extra configuration, I get an image that's about trimmed down to 117 MB. That's 226 MB or 65% savings.

<summary>Dockerfile concoction</summary>

You've been warned.

```dockerfile
FROM scratch as datadog
WORKDIR /download
ADD https://dtdg.co/latest-java-tracer /download/dd-java-agent.jar

FROM alpine as cert
RUN apk add --update --no-cache ca-certificates

FROM alpine as user
RUN adduser -D --uid 1001 --no-create-home roxy

FROM scratch as src
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./build/libs/*.jar /app/app.jar

FROM amazoncorretto:17-alpine as jre

RUN apk add --update --no-cache binutils

COPY --from=src /app/app.jar /app/app.jar

RUN jar xf /app/app.jar

RUN jdeps --ignore-missing-deps -q  \
    --recursive  \
    --multi-release 17  \
    --print-module-deps  \
    --class-path 'BOOT-INF/lib/*'  \
    /app/app.jar > deps.info

RUN jlink \
    --module-path $JAVA_HOME/jmods \
    --add-modules $(cat deps.info) \
    --output /opt/jre \
    --strip-debug \
    --no-man-pages \
    --no-header-files \
    --compress=2

FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app

ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/jre
ENV PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

COPY --from=jre "${JAVA_HOME}" "${JAVA_HOME}"
COPY --from=datadog --chown=1001 /download/dd-java-agent.jar /app/dd-java-agent.jar
COPY --from=cert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
COPY --from=user /etc/passwd /etc/passwd
COPY --from=src /app/app.jar /app/app.jar

USER 1001

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "-javaagent:/app/dd-java-agent.jar", "-Dmanagement.statsd.metrics.export.host=${STATSD_HOST}", "--add-exports=java.base/sun.net=ALL-UNNAMED", "/app/app.jar"]
```

The worst part about this is the JRE build explicitly requires knowledge of your application so it can detect whatever intrinsic modules it requires. We can't even abstract that extra complexity into another image. It's a bummer.

Have you considered writing [Go](https://go.dev/) instead?

[^1]: By default, I typically build artifacts outside of docker, because I tend to reuse all of the tooling for tests, build, and other analysis. If you do not need those common integration steps, then feel free to move your build step into a stage and copy the resulting jar from within.

[^2]: Image size is not all that important. It impacts ECR costs primarily, and also impacts load times elsewhere in the cluster secondarily.
