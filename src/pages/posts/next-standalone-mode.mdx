We run our Next webapps on a kubernetes cluster. There's a whole lot of infrastructure for some webapps these days. You know how it goes.

Since we run on a kubernetes cluster, we package our next webapps into docker images. Doing this the _naive_ way uses the following steps:

1. install all dependencies (dependencies + dev dependencies)
2. `yarn build` to build the `.next` folder
3. delete the `node_modules`
4. install only dependencies (no dev dependencies)
5. copy `.next`, `node_modules` and other meta files `package.json`, `yarn.lock`

At the end of all this, you might end up with a 500MB+ sized docker image. Being a frontend and a backend, you have more dependencies compared to an SPA (usually, sometimes). Meanwhile, there are tons of support files bundled togther in the image. Things that aren't necessary for the Next webapp to run either.

That's where [the _Output File Tracing_ feature](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing) comes in. I think _Standalone mode_ better a better name. Output File Tracing can produce the `standalone` folder with everything you need to run your Next webapp.

> This feature helps reduce the size of deployments drastically. Previously, when deploying with Docker you would need to have all files from your package's dependencies installed to run next start. Starting with Next.js 12, you can leverage Output File Tracing in the .next/ directory to only include the necessary files.

Set your `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
    // ...
    output: 'standalone',
}
```

Then update your `Dockerfile` to use the new standalone structure. These [details are mentioned](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing#automatically-copying-traced-files), but I thought they were unclear without an example `Dockerfile`:

>This will create a folder at .next/standalone which can then be deployed on its own without installing node_modules.
>
>Additionally, a minimal server.js file is also output which can be used instead of next start. This minimal server does not copy the public or .next/static folders by default as these should ideally be handled by a CDN instead, although these folders can be copied to the standalone/public and standalone/.next/static folders manually, after which server.js file will serve these automatically.
>
>Note: next.config.js is read during next build and serialized into the server.js output file. If the legacy serverRuntimeConfig or publicRuntimeConfig options are being used, the values will be specific to values at build time.

Here's my updated `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV="production"

# ---

COPY ./public ./public

# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
# https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing
COPY ./.next/standalone ./
COPY ./.next/static ./.next/static

CMD [ "node", "./server.js" ]
```

The docker image size reduction is huge. Going from 500MB+ to a much smaller 100MB.
