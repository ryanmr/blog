Recently, I had a tab structure that used React Router v6 to drive the actual routes with [createBrowserRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) and [Outlet](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/outlet).

The team behind React Router tends to revert to their previous implementation style every other version or so. We'll see if that remains true over time in the v6-era.

The new function [createBrowserRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) can be a little wonky when it gets nested, or at least it feels that way.

Here's the part of my router that handles the tab routes. I have a top level route and various children. There's a default and non-index children you can tab to. _Build_ is default, then _Services_ and _Pipeline_ are parallel routes.

```js
              {
                path: "/:org/:repo/:number",
                element: <RepoBuild />,
                children: [
                  {
                    element: <RepoBuildSteps />,
                    index: true,
                  },
                  {
                    path: "/:org/:repo/:number/services",
                    element: <ComingSoon title="Services" />,
                  },
                  {
                    path: "/:org/:repo/:number/pipeline",
                    element: <ComingSoon title="Pipeline" />,
                  },
                ],
              },
```

This is a small set of components 

```jsx
        <TabsContainer>
          <li>
            <NavLink
              to={`/${org}/${repo}/${number}`}
              className={getTabNavLinkCls()}
            >
              Build
            </NavLink>
          </li>
          <li>
            <NavLink
              to={`/${org}/${repo}/${number}/services`}
              className={getTabNavLinkCls()}
            >
              Service
            </NavLink>
          </li>
          <li>
            <NavLink
              to={`/${org}/${repo}/${number}/pipeline`}
              className={getTabNavLinkCls()}
            >
              Pipeline
            </NavLink>
          </li>
        </TabsContainer>
```

The problem I had was that NavLink was being too greedy. Whenever I was on the _Services_ tab for example, `/org/repo/123/services`, it would also light up the _Build_ tab. I needed those to be actively exclusively, the `index` was a default, but not a parent.

In the end, the trick was to use the [end prop provided by NavLink](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/nav-link#end).
